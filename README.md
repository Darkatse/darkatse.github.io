# What is this  
This repository is just use to build a small superconductor database for first principle calculation.  
The current version is only the initial beta version, and we may restructure it in the future.  
Elements that can superconduct at ***room temperature and normal atmosphere*** include Li,BE,Al,Ti,V,Zn,Ga,Y,Zr,Nb,Mo,Tc,Ru,Rh,Cd,In,Sn,Hf,Ta,W,Re,Os,Ir,Hg,Tl and Pb.  

# TODO  
* Improve UI  
* Show bands structure, phonon spectrum and density of electronic states
* Include type II superconductor  

# Thanks
I referred to a lot of information on [this website](http://www.openedx.net/5227.html) when establishing this repository, and I am deeply grateful to them here.
